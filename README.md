# My dot files

It's based on [LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS) but I've made some changes on it.

The main reason of this repo is just to keep my dotfiles on a safe place. Once I made a "fetch" mistakenly and it messed up my files. Now that I (at least think) re-made all my dotfiles, I'm creating this repo

Thank ya. Take a look at my other repos.
